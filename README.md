# Weather App

This week's project was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.
The project was part of Technigo Bootcamp.

Requirements completed:

**(Minimum Requirements)**
- Fetch data from the API using `fetch()` in JavaScript
- All required data should be present and fetched from the API
- The presentation of the data should be in a specified format.
- The page should work on mobile (mobile first!), tablet and desktop (Be responsive)

**(Intermediary Goals)**
- Change the colors of the page based on the weather. If the weather is warm â€“ use warm colors. If the weather is colder, use cold colors. If you really want to push you CSS muscles you can even make a background gradient.
- Include visual indicators for the type of weather, cloudy/sunny/rainy/etc.

## Tech Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, fetch data from API.

## The problem

I started out on monday doing mob-programming. We all found that mob-programming was a good way to faster get over the first obstcles and uncertainties that often occur when starting a new project. For me personally it also helped a lot in that I got a foundation that I could continue to build on on my own. 

I think this project was fun and I gained at least basic knowledge about how to fetch data from API:s. I might return to this project in the future and make it more advanced when my knowledge has improved.

I did a quite simple styling for this project, that didn't need too much tweaking to make it responsive.
I had some difficulties positioning the background image on .weathertoday using CSS background-size/object-fit/object-position. I couldn't get the pictures positioned where I wanted. I don't know why it didn't work, since I used this before on previous projects. I solved it by instead cropping the pictures, but they still don't have ideal position for bigger screens.
